RECOMMENDATION ITU-R BT.470-6*
CONVENTIONAL TELEVISION SYSTEMS
(Question ITU-R 1/11)
(1970-1974-1986-1994-1995-1997-1998)
Rec. ITU-R BT.470-6

The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly,
considering
a)
that many countries have established satisfactory monochrome television broadcasting services based on either
525-line or 625-line systems;
b)
that a number of countries have established (or are in the process of establishing) satisfactory colour television
broadcasting services based on the NTSC, PAL or SECAM systems;
c)
that the use of video component signals, signals consisting of the luminance and two colour difference signals,
with time compression and time division multiplexing, may offer picture quality benefits, using new types of television
receivers;
d)
that it would add further complications to the interchange of programmes to have a greater multiplicity of
systems,
recommends
1
that, for a country wishing to initiate a conventional monochrome television service, a system using 525- or
625-lines as defined in Annex 1 is to be preferred;
2
that, for conventional monochrome 625-line systems, the video-frequency characteristic described in
Recommendation ITU-R BT.472 is to be preferred;
3
that, for a country wishing to initiate a conventional colour television service, one of the systems defined in
Annex 1 is to be preferred.
NOTE 1 – Pre-1986 editions of the ex-CCIR Volumes, and in particular that of 1982, contain a complete description of
system E used in France until 1984, and system A used in the United Kingdom until 1985.
NOTE 2 – Pre-1997 editions of Recommendation ITU-R BT.470 contain a complete description of the SECAM IV
colour television system.

ANNEX 1

Characteristics of television systems

The following tables, given for information purposes, contain details of a number of different television systems in use at
the time of the Radiocommunication Assembly, 1995.
A list of countries and geographical areas, and the television systems used, are given in Appendix 1.
Information on the results of the comparative laboratory tests carried out on the various colour television systems in the
period 1963-1966 by broadcasting authorities, administrations and industrial organizations, together with the main
parameters of systems may be found in Reports 406 and 407, XIIth Plenary Assembly, New Delhi, 1970.
All television systems listed in this Annex employ an aspect ratio of the picture display (width/height) of 4/3, a scanning
sequence from left to right and from top to bottom and an interlace ratio of 2/1, resulting in a picture (frame) frequency
of half the field frequency. All systems are capable of operating independently of the power supply frequency.

Notes to Table 1:
(1)

The values in brackets apply to the combination N/PAL used in Argentina.

(2)

Figures are given for comparison.

(3)

Figures in brackets are valid for colour transmission.

(4)

In order to take full advantage of precision offset when the interfering carrier falls in the sideband of the upper video range (greater than 2 MHz) of the wanted signal a line-frequency stability of
at least 2 × 10–7 is necessary.

(5)

The exact value of the tolerance for line frequency when the reference of synchronism is being changed requires further study.

(6)

When the reference of synchronism is being changed, this may be relaxed to 15 625 ± 0.02%.

(7)

These values are not valid when the reference of synchronism is being changed.

(8)

Further study is required to define maximum variation rate of line frequency valid for colour transmission. In the United Kingdom and Japan this is 0.1 Hz/s.

(9)

It is also customary to define certain signal levels in 625-line systems, as follows:
= 0
= 30
= 100

For this scale, the peak level including chrominance signal for system D, K/SECAM equals 110.7. According to common studio operating practices, peak white-level = 100 corresponds to 1.0 V
measured across a matched 75 Ω termination.
(10)

+10
In Japan values 0 – 0 are used.

(11)

Value applies to PAL signals.

(12)

Values apply to SECAM signals. For programme exchange the value is 115.

(13)

Assumed value for overall gamma approximately 1.2. The gamma of the picture tube is defined as the slope of the curve giving the logarithm of the luminance reproduced as a function of the
logarithm of the video signal voltage when the brightness control of the receiver is set so as to make this curve as straight as possible in a luminance range corresponding to a contrast of at
least 1/40.

(14)

In Recommendation ITU-R BT.472, a gamma value for the picture signal is given as approximately 0.4.

fsc ± 1 300 kHz is adopted in the People’s Republic of China.
The unity value represents the amplitude of the luminance signal between the blanking level
and the peak white-level.
Provisionally, the tolerances may be extended up to the values given brackets.
During transmission of a monochrome programme of significant duration, in order to
ensure satisfactory operation of colour-killers in receivers, all signals having the same
nominal frequency as the colour sub-carrier that appears in the line-blanking interval,
should be attenuated by at least 35 dB below the peak-to-peak value of the burst given in
item 2.15, column 3 of Table 2, and shown as item 5 in Fig. 1.
The value given in Note (16) is accepted on a tentative basis.
Transmitter pre-correction for receiver group delay is not included.
For the use of automatic gain control circuits, it is important that the burst amplitude should
maintain the correct ratio with the chrominance signal amplitude.
Field 1 of the sequence of four fields in the NTSC video signal is defined by a whole line
between the first equalizing pulse and the preceding horizontal synchronizing pulse and a
negative-going zero-crossing of the reference sub-carrier nominally at the 50% point of the
first equalizing pulse. The zero-crossing of the reference sub-carrier shall be nominally
coincident with the 50% point of the leading edges of all horizontal synchronizing pulses
for programme integration at the studio.
Field 1 of the sequence of eight colour fields is defined as that field, where the phase ϕ EU′
of the extrapolated EU′ component (see item 2.5 of Table 2) of the video burst at the hall
amplitude point of the leading edge of the line synchronizing pulse of line 1 is in the range
′ < 90° .
– 90° ≤ ϕ EU
The value of the tolerance will be defined more precisely later.
The line identification method is preferable, because it will enable agreements to be
reached subsequently on the suppression of frame identification signals in international
programme exchanges. In the absence of such agreements, signals meeting the SECAM
standard are regarded as comprising such identification signals.
In France, a decree of 14 March 1978 specified that colour TV receivers placed on sale on
or after 1 December 1979 must use the line identification method of decoding. In France
and Ukraine, studies are taking place with a view to reducing the number of lines used for
field colour identification signals.
The order in which the identification signals D * and D* appear on the four fields of
R
B
a complete cycle given in Fig. 9 is in conformity with Recommendation ITU-R BR.469.

Notes to Table 2:
(1)
These values apply to the combination N/PAL used in Argentina. Only those values are (14)
given in this column which are different from the values given in the column B, G, H,

(3)
In Japan, the chromaticity of studio monitors is adjusted to a D-white at 9 300 K.
(4)
The primary signals are pre-corrected so that the optimum quality is obtained with a display (20)
having the indicated value of gamma.
(5)
In certain countries using the SECAM systems and in Japan it is also permitted to obtain the
luminance signal as a direct output from an independent photo-electric analyser instead of
from the primary signals.
(6)
For the SECAM system, it is allowable to apply a correction to reduce interference
distortions between the luminance and chrominance signals by an attenuation of the (21)
luminance signal components as a function of the amplitude of the luminance components
in the chrominance band.
(7)
This value will be defined more precisely later.
(8)
The maximum deviations from the nominal shape of the curve (see Fig. 6) should not (22)
exceed ± 0.5 dB in the frequency range from 0.1 to 0.5 MHz and ± 1.0 dB in the frequency (23)
range from 0.5 to 1.3 MHz.
(9)
When the signal originates from a portable or overseas source the tolerance on the
frequency may be relaxed to ± 5 Hz. Maximum rate of variation of fsc = 0.1 Hz/s.
(10)
This tolerance may not be maintained during such operational procedures as “genlock”.
(11)
A reduction of the tolerance is desirable.
(12)
The initial phase of the sub-carrier undergoes in each line a variation defined by the
following rule:
(24)
From frame to frame: by 0°: 180°: 0°: 180°: and so on, and also from line to line in either
one of the following two patterns:
0°: 0°: 180°: 0°: 0°: 180°: and so on,
or 0°: 0°: 0°: 180°: 180°: 180°: and so on.

In Japan, the values + 4.5 ± 0.001 are used.

(3)

In the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Switzerland a system of two sound carriers is used, the frequency of the second carrier being 242.1875 kHz
above the frequency of the first sound carrier. The ratio between vision/sound e.r.p. for this second carrier is 100/1. For further information on this system see Recommendation ITU-R BS.707.
For stereophonic sound transmissions a similar system is used in Australia with vision/sound power ratios being 20/1 and 100/1 for the first and second sound carriers respectively.

(4)

New Zealand uses a sound carrier displaced 5.4996 ± 0.0005 MHz from the vision carrier.

(5)

The sound carrier for single carrier sound transmissions in Australia may be displaced 5.5 ± 0.005 MHz from the vision carrier.

(6)

In Denmark, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden and Spain a system of two sound carriers is used. In Iceland, Norway and Poland the same system is being introduced. The second carrier is
5.85 MHz above the vision carrier and is DQPSK modulated with 728 kbit/s sound and data multiplex. The ratios between vision/sound power are 20/1 and 100/1 for the first and second carrier
respectively. For further information, see Recommendation ITU-R BS.707.

(7)

In the United Kingdom, a system of two sound carriers is used. The second sound carrier is 6.552 MHz above the vision carrier and is DQPSK modulated with a 728 kbit/s sound and data
multiplex able to carry two sound channels. The ratio between vision and sound e.r.p. for the second carrier is 100/1.

(8)

In France, a digital carrier 5.85 MHz away from the vision carrier may be used in addition to the main sound carrier. It is modulated in differentially encoded QPSK with a 728 kbit/s sound and
data multiplexer capable of carrying two sound channels. The nominal width of the main sideband is limited to 5.1 MHz. With the L standard, the depth of video modulation in the radiated
signal is reduced to leave a residual radiated carrier level of 5 ± 2%. For further information, see Recommendation ITU-R BS.707.

Rec. ITU-R BT.470-6

(28)

Notes to Table 3 (continued):
(9)

In France a vestigial sideband of 0.75 MHz is optionally used. In such cases, typical values to be used for minimum attenuation of vestigial sideband are 15 (–1.25) and 30 (–4.3) in dB at MHz.

(10)

In some cases, low-power transmitters are operated without vestigial-sideband filter.

(11)

For B/SECAM and G/SECAM: 30 dB at – 4.33 MHz, within the limits of ± 0.1 MHz.

(12)

In some countries, members of the former OIRT, additional specifications are in use:
a)

not less than 40 dB at – 4.286 MHz ± 0.5 MHz,

b)

0 dB from – 0.75 MHz to + 6.0 MHz,

c)

not less than 20 dB at ± 6.375 MHz and higher.

Reference: 0 dB at +1.5 MHz.
In the People’s Republic of China, the attenuation value at the point (– 4.33 ± 0.1) has not yet been determined.

(14)

Australia uses the nominal modulation levels specified for system I.

(15)

In Japan, the values of 0 to 6.75 have been adopted.

(16)

In the People’s Republic of China, the values 0 to 5 have been adopted.

(17)

Italy is considering the possibility of controlling the peak white-level after weighting the video frequency signal by a low-pass filter, so as to take account only of those spectrum components of
the signal that are likely to produce inter-carrier noise in certain receivers when the nominal level is exceeded. Studies should be continued with a view to optimizing the response of the
weighting filter to be used.

(18)

The former USSR has adopted the value 15 ± 2%.

(19)

A new parameter “white level with sub-carrier” should be specified at a later date. For that parameter, the former USSR has adopted the value of 7 ± 2%.

(20)

The peak white-level refers to a transmission without colour sub-carrier. The figure in brackets corresponds to the peak value of the transmitted signal, taking into account the colour sub-carrier
of the respective colour television system.

(21)

The values to be considered are:

Rec. ITU-R BT.470-6

(13)

– the r.m.s. value of the carrier at the peak of the modulation envelope for the vision signal. For system L, only the luminance signal is to be considered. (See Note(16) above);
– the r.m.s. value of the unmodulated carrier for amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated sound transmissions.
(22)

In Japan, a ratio of 1/0.15 to 1/0.35 is used. In the United States, the sound carrier e.r.p. is not to exceed 22% of the peak authorized vision e.r.p.

(23)

Recent studies in India confirm the suitability of a 20/1 ratio of effective radiated powers of vision and sound. This ratio still enables the introduction of a second sound carrier.

(24)

The ratio 10/1 is used in the Republic of South Africa.

19

20

Notes to Table 3 (continued):
The ratio 20:1 is used in the United Kingdom.

(26)

In the People’s Republic of China, the value 10/1 has been adopted.

(27)

In France, the ratios 10/1 and 40/1 are used.

(28)

In the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands the correction for receiver group-delay characteristics is made according to curve B in Fig. 3a). Tolerances are shown in the table under
Fig. 3a). Spain uses curve A. Some former OIRT countries using the B/SECAM and G/SECAM systems use a nominal pre-correction of 90 ns at medium video frequencies. In Sweden, the precorrection is 0 ± 40 ns up to 3.6 MHz. For 4.43 MHz, the correction is –170 ± 20 ns and for 5 MHz it is –350 ± 80 ns. In New Zealand the pre-correction increases linearly from 0 ± 20 ns at
0 MHz to 60 ± 50 ns at 2.25 MHz, follows curve A of Fig. 3a) from 2.25 MHz to 4.43 MHz and then decreases linearly to –300 ± 75 ns at 5 MHz. In Australia, the nominal pre-correction
follows curve A up to 2.5 MHz, then decreases to 0 ns at 3.5 MHz, –170 ns at 4.43 MHz and –280 ns at 5 MHz. Based on studies on receivers in India, the receiver group delay pre-equalization
proposed to be adopted in India at 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 3 MHz, 4.43 MHz and 4.8 MHz is +125 ns, +150 ns, +142 ns, –75 ns and –200 ns respectively. In Denmark, the precorrections at 0, 0.25,
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.8, 4.43 and 4.8 MHz are 0, +5, +53, +75, +75, 0, –170 and 400 ns.

(29)

Not yet determined. The former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic proposed +90 ns (nominal value).

(30)

Not yet determined. The former Czechoslovak Socialist Republic proposed +25 ns (nominal value).

(31)

In Poland no group-delay precorrection is used.

(32)

In the United Kingdom, for PAL transmissions in the upper-adjacent channel to a DVB-T service, the nominal width of the vestigial sideband is proposed to be 0.75 MHz, with minimum
attenuations of the vestigial sideband of 20 (–1.25), 45 (–1.45) in dB at MHz. Such transmission will be referred to as System II.

This information has been taken from the preliminary requirements file as submitted by the Administrations concerned to the
ITU in preparation of the Second Session of the Regional Administrative Conference for the planning of VHF/UHF television
broadcasting in the African Broadcasting Area and Neighbouring Countries (AFBC(2)). In a number of cases transmitters
using different systems from those indicated in the requirements file may continue to operate for a transitional period.

(2)

The Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands use an additional FM carrier for stereophonic or twochannel sound transmission.

(3)

Australia uses nominal modulation levels as specified for System I. For stereophonic sound transmission, an additional FM
carrier is used similar to the system used in the Federal Republic of Germany.

(4)

Denmark, Spain, Finland, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, the United Kingdom and Sweden have approved the use of
an additional digital carrier for stereophonic or multi-channel sound transmission.

(5)

In the French Overseas departments and territories, the system K1 is used instead of L/SECAM which is used in the
metropolitan area.

(6)

In France, the use the NICAM system for stereophonic or multi-channel sound transmission is being investigated for
K1/SECAM.

(7)

System I will be used at all stations though with a vision-to-sound ratio of up to 10/1. In addition Ireland reserves the right to
the possible use of an additional sound carrier in the band between 5.5 MHz and 6.75 MHz in relation to the vision carrier.

(8)

No final decision has been taken about the width of the residual sideband, but for planning purposes this country is willing to
accept the assumption of a residual sideband 1.25 MHz wide.

(9)

In New Zealand the modulation levels are identical to those of System I.

(10)

The United Kingdom has ceased to use Bands I and III for television broadcasting.

(11)

Singapore reserves the right to use additional frequency-modulated sound channels in the band between 5.5 and 6.5 MHz in
relation to the picture carrier, for additional sound channels for sound broadcasting.

(12)

The Swiss Administration is planning to use additional frequency-modulated sound carriers, in the frequency interval between
the spacings of 5.5 and 6.5 MHz in relation to the picture carrier, at levels lower than or equal to the normal level of the sound
carrier, for additional sound-tracks or for sound broadcasting.

(13)

In Tunisia SECAM is used for broadcasting the national programmes; PAL is used for rebroadcasting other programmes.

(14)

It is a case of a gradual transition from the D, K/SECAM system to the B1, G/PAL system. Characteristics are identical to
system G. VHF channel numbers remain R1 to R12.

(15)

1998 characteristics of digital systems are expected to be drawn up.

(16)

Poland uses only Band III for television broadcasting in VHF.

ANNEX 2

Colorimetric standards in colour television

1
In 1953, when the NTSC colour television system was adopted for transmission in the United States of
America, the colorimetry of the system was based on three specific primary colours and a reference white. The
coordinates of the primaries were (the coordinates are given in the CIE system (1931)):
Red:

x = 0.67

y = 0.33

Green:

x = 0.21

y = 0.71

Blue:

x = 0.14

y = 0.08.

The reference white chosen was standard:
White C:

x = 0.310

y = 0.316.

2
When the PAL and SECAM systems were first designed, they were based upon the colorimetric standards
of NTSC. As a result, the coefficients used for determining the signals involved in coding PAL and SECAM (the
luminance signal and the colour-difference signals) were directly based upon the chromaticities given in § 1.
3
However, it has been recognized that there have been continuing changes in the chromaticities of the phosphors
used in making colour picture tubes over the years, and that those actually used do not have the same primary
chromaticities as those which served to establish the coding of systems. Nevertheless, in all systems the coefficients used
for determining the signals involved in coding (the luminance signal and the colour-difference signals) are directly based
upon the chromaticities and white point given in § 1.
4
Several solutions have been proposed or implemented, in different countries, for compensating or correcting
the effect upon colour reproduction of this difference between the receiver characteristics and the standards given in § 1.
5
The United States of America continues to base the colorimetry of its transmissions upon NTSC primaries
whose chromaticities and white point are defined in § 1. Studio monitors are adjusted to a reference white of D65.
However, because picture tubes do not yet contain phosphors whose chromaticities are the same (or very nearly the
same) as those defined in § 1, approximate corrections, involving operations upon the electrical signals, are made in
receivers in order to achieve satisfactory colour reproduction. Further, to achieve greater consistency in colour
transmissions, the United States of America recommends that the picture monitors used in studios should also contain
correction circuits which cause the colour reproduction to approximate to that which would have been obtained if the
picture tubes used in the monitors had contained phosphors with the primary chromaticities shown in § 1.

6
In Japan, the colorimetry of the system is based upon the primary chromaticities and white point given in § 1.
Studio monitors are adjusted to a white point of D, 9 300 K.
7
In the 625-line PAL and SECAM systems, the colorimetry is now based upon the three specific primary
colours (see Note 1):
Red:

x = 0.64

y = 0.33

Green:

x = 0.29

y = 0.60

Blue:

x = 0.15

y = 0.06

and reference white D65.
These chromaticities are closely representative of the phosphors incorporated in the picture tubes of many of the
receivers and studio monitors used in those countries that have adopted the 625-line PAL and SECAM systems. Thus, in
such receivers and monitors, no electrical corrections are required in order to achieve good colour reproduction. Further,
in order to improve the consistency of colour reproduction, when the television receiver is switched from one programme
to another, it has been suggested that the chromaticities of the phosphors used in studio monitors should be standardized.
The assessment is based upon a method of tolerance which takes account of both the primary chromaticities of the tube
phosphors and the effect of their combined chromaticities upon the reproduction of a typical skin tone.
NOTE 1 – These coordinates are given in the CIE system (1931). For 625-line SECAM systems, it is provisionally
permitted (for existing equipment), to use the chromaticity coordinates and reference white given in § 1.
